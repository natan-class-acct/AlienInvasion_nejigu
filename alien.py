Program Name: alien.py
Author: Natan Ejigu
Purpose: Represents a single alien in the fleet, for Track 1
         (Custom Game Mechanics). Since the ship is positioned at
         the top of the screen and fires downward, the fleet is
         inverted: aliens start near the bottom of the screen and
         will advance upward toward the ship (rather than starting
         at the top and moving down, as in the base book tutorial).
Starter code: Alien class structure based on the Alien Invasion
    project from Python Crash Coursse, Starting position changed
    from near the top-left to near the bottom-left of the screen,
    and alien drawn as a placeholder shape instead of loaded from
    a file, per Track 1 requirements.
