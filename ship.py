Program Name: ship.py
Author: Natan Ejigu
Purpose: Manages the player's ship for Track 1 (Custom Game
         Mechanics). The ship is loaded from a custom image file
         and positioned at the TOP center of the screen (instead of
         the bottom, as in the base book tutorial), and can move
         left and right in response to player input.
Starter code: Ship class structure based on the Alien Invasion
    project from Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition, by Eric Matthes
    (https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e). Custom ship artwork
    (ship21.png) supplied by the author and rotated 180 degrees so
    the nose points downward, matching the ship's firing direction.
    Starting position changed from midbottom to midtop, per Track 1
    requirements.
